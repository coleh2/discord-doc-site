# v1.2.0

* Table of Contents
{:toc}

Note: I tried to make these as comprehensive as possible (as in, a warthog could be a moderator if they follow the rules), but if you think something can be changed, DM me @coleh.

## Section 1: Basic Rules
    
1.  Have fun!
2.  Hate speech is not tolerated.
3.  Spam is not allowed. This includes basic spam, misplaced NSFW images, and/or excessive cursing.
4.  Impersonation, whether of someone we know IRL or on the internet, is prohibited without the explicit permission of the person in question.
5.  Names should be phonetically pronounceable and not be offensive.

## Section 2: Technical Definitions
    
Spam
: Two messages by the same person within 1 day that both say @everyone
: No images in #general
: Any NSFW image posted in a non-NSFW chat

Impersonation
: Purposefully pretending to be someone who you are not.

Excessive
: More than 60%; can be chosen otherwise by a moderator

Hate Speech
: Messages that personally attack another user based on their identity

Bot

We
: The majority of the community.
    
## Section 3: Exceptions
    
Your name is not required to be phonetically pronounceable if:

*   It is more than 60% similar to your IRL name (first or last)

*   It is two syllables or less.

Spam is allowed if:

*   The person in question (the spammer) is a bot.

## Section 4: Consequences
    
Violations of any rules will probably result in a warning about the consequences of more rule-breaking.

Violations of Rule 1 will result in stern looks from the higher-ups.

Violations of Rule 2 will result in:

    *   First offense: 1 hour.

    *   For the fifth offense, this will last 30 minutes.
    *   For the sixth offense, this will last 2 hours.
    *   For the seventh offense, this will last 6 hours.
