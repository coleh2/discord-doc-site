# v3.2.0

1.  Game hate is no longer punishable
2.  Admins are not above the law and we shall follow all of the rules
3.  Obvious spam is punishable
4.  Server drama is not punishable though I think some people may look down on it
5.  I am assuming elections will be like Nick said, "we formalize elections to take place during the weeks leading up to the summer and winter solstices? Basically, a new King would take power on June 21st and December 21st every year. Also, our server anniversary is December 20th, so the 21st would be the first day of the 'New Year'. One King would serve till June 21st, and another would finish out the year. Terms are six months. I think formalizing these dates adds more authenticity to the elections, and our server structure as a whole. Note: John would serve until December 21st, 2019 if we implemented this, since Charlie left his position early."
