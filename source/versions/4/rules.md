# Rules while I am King (and hopefully others use these as well):

## Part 1 - Spam:

What is spamming in one channel certainly isnt in another. For example, 50 pictures of cute animals back to back in #cuteness-overload wont be considered spamming while 50 votes in #voting would be. Unless if you are obviously spamming (sending one message or pic over and over again) then you will be warned to stop. If you continue then you will be muted for 5 mins and you have to delete your messages along with dming me an apology which will be posted on the weekly news updates.

## Part 2 - Politics

Everything political should go in the chat #paulitics if a post turns political then please move the chat to #paulitics. If you keep debating politics while not in #paulitics (after being warned) then you will face the same punishment that people who spam get (Part 1). 
Furthermore, I would like to add that any political opinions are allowed in this server and you will not be banned for sharing your views. If you dont think that trans-genders are human or support the organisation that is blm then you will not be punished. As long as you are not spamming your views (left or right) then you are free to say whatever. That is not to say people wont hate you if you post pictures of yourself at a KKK rally but censorship will not be used while I am King (and hopefully others follow my example).

## Part 3 - Names:

If you have a name that doesnt sound like your name then please put your name in parenthesis. 

example of bad names:

ree  
Ilikepizza  
diamonds  

example of good names:

iron_ore(Bob)  
Bob the Cow  
ree(Bob B.)  
Mr. B  

## Part 4 - Votes:

First of all, as a reminder, votes are suggestions and while I will listen to most of them I am not required to do so. The purpose is to see what you all want and to see if you like a change, hate it, or simply do not have a preference. However here are some clarifying rules, 1, in order for a change to be considered it has to be put in voting so I know what other people think, 2, If I find that a vote is simply spam I will delete it (and you will face the same punishment for spamming), 3, If a vote is something that will really change the server (like a new section or electing stuff) then dm it to me and it will be put here.

## Part 5 - Elections:

So most of this stuff has already been voted on so I will just list it here (along with some other stuff). A potential King runs with a Hand of their choosing, the King gains ownership of the server while the Hand gains admin. No leader (King or Hand) can be in power (have admin) two terms in a row. In order (for King) to run you need to put me in a dm chat with you, your Hand, and three others who will vote for you and only you. 

Alright this was just my quick update on the rules and I should be done (unless if I think of something else) :slight_smile:

## Part 6 - Saying first after a channel is created:

Don't.

## Part 7- Breaking the rules of an individual chat:

Lets say you are in a chat like #hamilton were the clear intention typing out the verses and you say "I like pizza" or "this chat sucks" then you will be warned about it and three warnings leads to punishment for spam. Basically try not to mess up a chat that has a theme to it.

## Part 8 - #general , #images-and-videos ,and #memes :

#general is used for basic conversation and discussion. You are allowed to post an image or video in #general if it relates to the discussion. Discussions regarding an image or video or if you just want to post a cool video or image then use #images-and-videos. The motto for #images-and-videos is "less is more", if you want to post a lot of images or videos then do that in #memes. Anything that you think would qualify as a meme would also go in #memes. This is not an exact science and there wont really be an issue unless if somebody is spamming memes in #general or #images-and-videos or having a political discussion in #memes.

## Part 9 - Simplified punishments:

Basically, unless if what you are doing is obvious spam then you will get three warnings. If you reach three warnings or are obviously spamming then you will be muted until you send me an apology via dms which will be posted in #news. This section was just to clear up confusion and summarize.

## Part 10 - Political memes:

Sorry for not making this clear but all political memes need to be put in #paulitics. If a political memes channel is ever made then that will also be an acceptable place to put political memes. The punishment will be the same as posting politics in a chat that is not politics.
