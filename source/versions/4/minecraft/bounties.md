# Bounties

You can, whenever you want, put a bounty on someone. A bounty is a set of items that you'll give someone else for killing the target. You can't undo or change a bounty once it's set, so be careful!

If multiple people set a bounty on one target, a kill can only be used to claim one bounty, *unless* the bounty-givers decide otherwise.

Your server may not use the Bounty rules. If you're not sure,check with an admin to make sure before setting or carrying out a bounty.
