# Basic SMP Rules

This is a very basic set of rules to be used where no rules should really be needed, but just in case.

## No griefing.
If someone else has built on an area, then breaking their building, excessively breaking the ground, or building something else over it isn't okay (unless you get their permission)

## No lag machines
Don't build something intended to create lag. If you accidentally build one, then please take it down when notified.

## Admin decisions are final (kinda)
Admins can roll back, reset, and refund whatever items, buildings, or blocks they see fit. If an admin makes a decision you don't like, then ask another admin about it. If they disagree, they can undo it and talk to the first admin about it.

## No Killing People

Don't kill people if they don't agree to it (e.g. in a PvP duel), unless the server has some sort of bounty system or some other rule that says you can.

## Don't Hack

Using bad-faith modified clients (like Wurst) is forbidden. Using good-faith modified clients (like Optifine or a minimap) is okay.

## The Anti-Rules Lawyer Bit

The list of rules here shouldn't be seen as the only rules! Again, admin decisions are final, and if an admin decides something is breaking the spirit of one of these rules, then don't argue that it's *technically* not rule-breaking.
