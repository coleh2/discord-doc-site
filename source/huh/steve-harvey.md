# Steve Harvey

I can't really say that Steve Harvey was invented by Charlie. Still, if you see Steve Harvey mentioned in NHS, it's probably because of Charlie.

Steve Harvey is a reoccurring joke of Charlie. Steve Harvey usually shows up in voice calls, where Charlie will use his voice to say, "I'm Steve Harvey" abruptly. Recently, Steve Harvey has shown up in text chats as well.

Charlie has prayed to Steve Harvey for help in challenging games. After prayer, he usually receives excellent outcomes from bad situations (e.g., 40 sea serpent scales, when an average drop is 7). Steve Harvey is, according to Charlie, the lord of thermodynamics. The third law of thermodynamics is Steve Harvey.

Steve Harvey is married to Poseiden, who, in turn, has a deal with the sea.
