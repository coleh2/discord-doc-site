## About

This repository contains both the markdown files used to generate documentation, and tools to compile those markdown files.
Please note that some elements of the documentation pages are generated by custom parsers, and will not work in a standard markdown parser. In order to build on your local machine, please follow the instructions below.

This project uses a modified version of [Highcharts](https://highchartsjs.com) under a Creative Commons BY-NC licence. It supports charts without a browser engine. If you want to use this in your own project, feel free to do so (provided you follow the same license terms)! It can be accessed in the `build-scripts` directory and used the way same as the original version.

## Installation

In order to install, you must have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (if installing on Windows, make sure to include Git Bash in the wizard; this makes sure that install scripts will work correctly)
and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). All other dependencies are automatically installed after.

Once you have Git and Node installed, you must first clone the repository to your computer.
First, you need to know what terminal app you're going to use. A terminal is a text-based way of interacting with your computer.
On Windows, this is Git Bash; it's included with Git.
On Mac and Linux, there's a pre-installed app called Terminal that you can use.


First, open up your terminal from the Search menu, and enter `git clone https://github.com/coleh2/discord-doc-site.git`.
After this finishes, enter `cd discord-doc-site` to open up the folder you just downloaded. 
It's hard to see from the terminal, but if you look at `Users\<your name>\discord-doc-site` in your file explorer, all project files should have downloaded!

Next, go back to the terminal. You should notice that the text in front of your cursor now reads `~/discord-doc-site`; this will be a readout of the current folder that git bash has open.
In order to switch to the currently-developing version of the project, not the version that's on the Internet now, you should enter `git checkout develop`.
On Windows (i.e. in Git Bash), the blue text before your cursor should now read `(develop)` instead of `(master)`-- on Mac and Linux, it won't change but you shouldn't worry.

After you've done that, you're good to go! You can change whatever files you want (the documentation pages can be found in the `source` folder)-- any text editor, such as Notepad or TextEdit, will be able to open the `.md` files. 
The syntax of Markdown is pretty simple to learn; Discord uses a variety of it for formatting in messages, so you may have a good base to build on already.
A useful cheatsheet for the full syntax can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

If you plan on editing a lot, you may want to look in to getting a dedicated code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Once you're made your changes, you can preview the build results by [building locally](#building-locally)

# Building Locally

In order to build locally, you must first install build dependencies-- luckily, this is easy to do with Node! 
Make sure your terminal is open and navigated to the project folder (you should see `discord-doc-site` before your cursor), and then enter `npm install`. 
This command may take a bit depending on your computer's speed.

Next, enter `npm run build` to start the build. This should take a moderate amount of time; if it takes over 5m on a relatively recent computer, something has gone wrong.

In order to preview the files exactly as they will appear online, you can enter `npm start` to start a debugging server.
It will tell you a web address that you can enter into your web browser to connect to the local server; this should appear just like the version that's published on the Internet!
