            var pageIndex = {"/about-semver":{"id":"/about-semver","title":"About Semver","text":"# Semantic Versioning\n\n## What is it?\n\nSemantic versions, or \"semver\", is a way of formatting version numbers. A bunch of things use it-- \"Minecraft 1.15.2\" is an example; the first number (1) is the \"major version\", the second number (15) is the minor version, and the third number (2) is the patch version. More information can be found [here](https://semver.org/).\n\n## How does this project use it?\n\nWhen making an edit, you should increase the *major* version if:\n\n* There is a major edit; a complete change of format\n\nWhen making an edit, you should increase the *minor* version if:\n\n* There is a smaller edit, like a rule addition or removal, that nevertheless changes the meaning of the document\n\nWhen making an edit, you should increase the *patch* version if:\n\n* You're only changing or clarifying something (e.g. a grammar fix)\n\nWhenever you increase a number, you should reset all less-signifigant numbers to 0 (so a major increase will set both the minor and patch to 0).\n\nOnly major versions get preserved forever publically on this website, but *all* changes (including changes to files that don't belong to a version, such as this one) are accessible through GitHub in markdown format.\n\n## What can I change? Are older versions unchangable?\n\nYeah, kind of. You can change the format (for example, they were transfered from HTML to Markdown in v4.0.0), but their content is unchangable.\n\n"},"/about-site":{"id":"/about-site","title":"About Site","text":"# About the Site\n\n## Why?\n\nPutting things in Discord gives no control over interface, only very basic control over organization, and limited features (images, links, etc). A custom-made markdown-based website (this one!) gives us a relatively low entry barrier to contributing, while greatly expanding the possibilities over a Discord channel.\n\n## How do I contribute? Who can contribute?\n\nAnybody, at any time! If you want to publish something that you think is useful, feel free to make a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/coleh2/discord-doc-site); it has a web-based editor, so there's no need to download the project to your computer.\n\nIf you want to add a custom feature (such as a new type of diagram for people to use, a change to the script that builds the site, etc), that's also definitely allowed-- same procedure, except if you're adding something that others will use, please do some testing-- try to document any tests you've done in your pull request.\n\nIf your addition isn't immediately added, don't worry! Chances are, I just haven't seen it yet. Every request should at least get a comment in response. \n\n### Can I become an admin and help that way?\n\nI'd be glad to accept help! You don't really need technical experience, but a basic understanding of how Git works is good, as well as knowledge of web development if you want.\n\n## Is this affiliated with {person or group}?\n\nThis is made & maintained by @coleh. Any pages that have been written or edited by others will say so.\n\n## This page looks bad\n\nIf it's an actual bug, please take a screenshot and post it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/coleh2/discord-doc-site/issues) on GitHub. If you don't like the design, then still feel free to make an issue-- if you have a pet peeve to fix, a request to make the site better, or any other feedback, I'd love to hear it!\n\n## How is this site hosted? How do we know you're not changing the rules?\n\nThis site is hosted on Netlify, a static site hosting service. Whenever a new version of the site is put up on the [\"master\" Git branch](https://github.com/coleh2/discord-doc-site/tree/master/), GitHub compiles that into a web-viewable version, and then puts that version onto the  [\"publish\" Git branch](https://github.com/coleh2/discord-doc-site/tree/publish/). Netlify sees this and deploys it to their servers. You can be sure I'm not changing the rules behind anyone's back because Git doesn't allow that-- every change submitted is cryptographically linked to those made before; it's extremely difficult if not impossible to falsely edit the pages on this site.\n\n## Is there any way I can contact you that isn't GitHub?\n\nYeah! I'm @coleh on Discord, and coleh@coleh.net for email."},"/versions/1-1-0":{"id":"/versions/1-1-0","title":"1 1 0","text":"# v1.1.0\n\n* Table of Contents\n{:toc}\n\nNote: I tried to make these as comprehensive as possible (as in, a warthog could be a moderator if they follow the rules), but if you think something can be changed, DM me @coleh.\n\n## Section 1: Basic Rules\n\n1.

Only send a message when the last messenger is not you-- you can count up from others' numbers, but not your own.\n3. You may only include alphabetical messages through edits. Common practice is to use parentheses after your number when doing this.\n    a. If the last two digits of your message are \"69\", after sending, you are strongly advised to edit your message to include \"(nice)\" after.\n4. Use of bots, macros, and other counting machines is not allowed. That's not being a good sport.\n\n## Useful Things to Know\n\nAdam has made a bot that enforces most of the guidelines above. However, it gets out of tune sometimes, and needs to be reset; if it's deleting your messages, send `<c reset` to the #bot-poking channel. Adam's bot should acknowledge the command and stop doing that.\n\nSometimes, when in a \"rally\" (quickly counting up when two or more people are active in `#counting` at the same time), Discord will lag out.

Currently, there is an unspecified syntax that serves this purpose, but it has several unclear parts, such as: \n\n* Scope (when quoting should be used instead)\n* Subtypes and their intended usages (e.g. `^^^` vs `^3`)\n* Extensions to the current unspoken standard (e.g.` ^name`)\n* Meaning (agreement vs. simple reference)\n\nDespite these, this specification will attempt to be backwards-compatible with the majority of current usage. This document should be by no means considered to be a new, mandatory specification to follow, but rather a clarifying document for confusion and an formal explaination for the current syntax. \"Incorrect\" usage should not be construed as an offensive or negative action.\n\nAs such, this specification is established as a clear way to unambiguously reference a previous message on instant messaging platforms, whether for agreement, additional\ndiscussion, indication as context, or for other purposes.\n\n## Required Technical Knowledge\n\nThis document has been written to require little to no additional knowledge in order to understand properly. The diagrams that describe the syntax are [railroad diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_diagram), a visual representation of syntax intended to be easy to understand. Each diagram defines a part of the syntax, and then may be referred to by other railroad diagrams. If you don't understand any part, feel free to ask; any questions are very helpful to improve the document.\n\n## Definitions\n\nbackreference\n: A string of text that indicates a previous message\n\ncurrent message\n: The message that has the backreference in it.\n\nyoungest message\n: most recently sent, not counting the current message\n\noldest message\n: least recently sent, not counting the current message\n\n## General Backreference Specification\n\n### Backreference Usage\n\nAll backreferences must start with a caret character (`^`). All backreferences should be formatted as a seperate word to avoid ambiguity with other uses of the caret character, such as exponents. A message solely consisting of a backreference should be seen as a general agreement with the message it refers to. However, if there is any other text in the message, its meaning takes precedence over the implicit agreement. \n\n---\n\n### Syntax\n\n~~~\nbackreference = (singular backreference | plural backreference | filtered backreference);\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram}\n\nYou can test out backreferences and see how they work in this interactive Syntax Explorer, which is pre-loaded with some messages to search.\n\n<script src=\"/versions/4/asset/syntax-check-widget.js\" defer></script>\n<div class=\"syntax-checker-widget\">\n</div>\n---\n\n### I'm a Computer; How Do I Read These?\n\nYou can get an [EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) syntax for backreferences here:\n\n~~~\ndigit = \"0\" | \"1\" | \"2\" | \"3\" | \"4\" | \"5\" | \"6\" | \"7\" | \"8\" | \"9\";\nnumber = { digit };\nletter = \"A\" | \"B\" | \"C\" | \"D\" | \"E\" | \"F\" | \"G\" | \"H\" | \"I\" | \"J\" | \"K\" | \"L\" | \"M\" | \"N\" | \"O\" | \"P\" | \"Q\" | \"R\" | \"S\" | \"T\" | \"U\" | \"V\" | \"W\" | \"X\" | \"Y\" | \"Z\" | \"a\" | \"b\" | \"c\" | \"d\" | \"e\" | \"f\" | \"g\" | \"h\" | \"i\" | \"j\" | \"k\" | \"l\" | \"m\" | \"n\" | \"o\" | \"p\" | \"q\" | \"r\" | \"s\" | \"t\" | \"u\" | \"v\" | \"w\" | \"x\" | \"y\" | \"z\" ;\nsymbol = \"[\" | \"]\" | \"{\" | \"}\" | \"(\" | \")\" | \"<\" | \">\" | \"'\" | '\"' | \"=\" | \"|\" | \".\" | \",\" | \";\";\ncharacter = symbol | digit | letter;\nword = { letter };\nphrase = { word | \" \" | symbol };\nname = word;\nsubject = word;\nmessage text = phrase;\n\nsingular backreference = caret count backreference | caret quantity backreference | quote;\ncaret count backreference = { \"^\" } ;\ncaret quantity backreference = \"^\", number ;\nquote = \"^\" , \"\\\"\" , message text , \"\\\"\";\nplural backreference = backreference range | backreference sequence;\nbackreference range = singular backreference , \"-\" , singular backreference\nbackreference sequence = backreference , { \",\" , backreference }\nfiltered backreference = { backreference filter } , (* treat as ^ *) | singular backreference | plural backreference;\nbackreference filter = author backreference filter | message subject filter;\nauthor backreference filter = \"^\" , [ \"@\" ], name;\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram-source-collection .download-file-instead-of-display data-filename=\"backreference.ebnf\"}\n\n---\n\n### Future Backreference Usage\n\nThe caret character is part of Markdown, the formatting language that Discord uses; it is used to convey superscript. Currently, superscript is disabled, but should Discord activate this functionality, an escape character (specifically the backslash, `\\`) may be used in front of carets to continue using backreferences normally. If that is considered too annoying for a day-to-day basis at the time, a revision of the syntax will be made.\n\n\n## Singular Backreferences\n\nSingular backreferences are the building blocks that serve as a base to construct other backrefernces. Each one references only one single message. Backreferences are specified here in terms of relativity, with relative backreferences at the start and absolute backreferences at the end.\n\n~~~\nsingular backreference = caret count backreference | caret quantity backreference | quote;\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram}\n\n### Caret Count Backreference\n\nCaret count backreferences reference a message relative to the message that they are sent in. A single caret references the message directly before the current one, a double caret references the message two messages previous, etc. \n\n#### Syntax\n\n~~~\ncaret count backreference = { \"^\" } ;\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram}\n\n#### Examples: \n\n~~~\n^\n~~~\n{: .language-backreference}\n\nThis backreference refers to the youngest message.\n\n~~~\n^^\n~~~\n{: .language-backreference}\n\nThis backreference refers to the second youngest message.\n\n#### Inconsistencies to Note\n\nIn some internet dialects, carets are used to reference in agreement the directly previous message, with more carets representing a stronger agreement. This is not the syntax used here, but it may be carried over when images are posted. The default number of carets in such usages is 3.\n\n#### Scope\n\nCaret count backreferences should not be used when the message referenced is over five messages ago. If an older reference is to be referenced, [caret quantities](#caret-quantity-backreference) should be used. However, any number of carets is technically valid.\n\n---\n\n### Caret Quantity Backreference\n\nCaret quantities reference a message relative to the message that they are sent in. They are different from caret count backreferences in that they use a single caret, followed by a number; this allows them to reference older messages without causing annoyance by the necessity of counting the carets. In order to be distinct from exponents in mathematical equations, they must be in their own word.\n\n#### Syntax\n\n~~~\ncaret quantity backreference = \"^\", number ;\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram}\n\n#### Examples\n\n~~~\n^2\n~~~\n{: .language-backreference}\n\nThis backreference refers to the second-youngest message.\n\n~~~\n^7\n~~~\n{: .language-backreference}\n\nThis backreference refers to the seventh-youngest message.\n\n#### Scope\n\nCaret quantities may be used for reference to messages as recent as the second-youngest (i.e. `^2`). For brevity, referring to the youngest message (with `^1`) is discouraged, as this may be accomplished easier with a single [caret count](#caret-count-backreference) backreference. Caret quantities should not be used to reference messages older than the 12th-youngest (e.g. `^12`)-- if an older message should be referenced, an [author backreference](#author-backreference-filter) or a [quote](#quote) should be used. However, any number is technically valid.\n\n---\n\n### Quote Backreference\n\nQuotes unambiguously refer to a message by its content. Quotes may be done in a Discord-sanctioned format by right-clicking a message and hitting the \"Quote\" option. As such, there is no defined syntax for this backreference method when it is used alone. However, for combining with other backreferences, there is a [seperate syntax](#quote-backreference-filter).\n\n#### Scope\n\nQuotes may be used to refer to any message, but in order to prevent the clogging of chat, if any relative backreference method ([caret count](#caret-count-backreference) or  [caret quantity](#caret-quantity-backreference)) is recommended for the message, that should be used instead.\n\n## Plural Backreferences\n\nAll backreference types above this entry are singular; they reference only one message. In some cases, a user may wish to indicate more than one message at once. To do this, plural backreferences can be used, which combine multiple singular singular backreferences in order to reference more than one.\n\n\n~~~\nplural backreference = backreference range | backreference sequence;\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram}\n\n### Backreference Ranges\n\nRanges can be used to indicate more than one message at once. To make a range, join two backreferences with a hyphen. The first backreference indicates the first message that is referenced, and the second indicates the last message. Ranges may be defined chronologically (oldest-youngest) or anti-chronologically (youngest-oldest); they are the same. Any singular backreferences may be used.\n\n#### Syntax\n\n~~~\nbackreference range = singular backreference , \"-\" , singular backreference\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram}\n\n#### Examples\n\n~~~\n^3-^5\n~~~\n{: .language-backreference}\n\nThis range refers to the all messages from the third-youngest to fifth-youngest messages.\n\n~~~\n^@sam-^@nick^4\n~~~\n{: .language-backreference}\n\nThis backreference refers to all messages from the youngest message by Sam through the fourth-youngest message by Nick.\n\n#### Scope\n\nAs a combination of other backreferences, ranges have no defined scope of their own, but the recommendations of each endpoint should be satisfied.\n\n### Backreference Sequences\n\nBackreference sequences are an alternate method of indicating multiple messages. It allows more fine-grained control than ranges, but is longer. To make a sequence, join backreferences to each referenced message with a comma. *Any* backreference may be used in a sequence, including ranges and sequences themselves.\n\n#### Syntax \n\n~~~\nbackreference sequence = backreference , { \",\" , backreference }\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram}\n\n#### Examples\n\n~~~\n^^,^^^^\n~~~\n{: .language-backreference}\n\nThis range refers to the second-youngest and fourth-youngest messages.\n\n~~~\n^,^^^,^5-^7\n~~~\n{: .language-backreference}\n\nThis backreference refers to the youngest message, the fourth-youngest message, and the fifth-youngest through seventh-youngest messages.\n\n#### Scope\n\nAs a combination of other backreferences, sequences have no defined scope of their own, but the recommendations of each endpoint should be satisfied.\n\n## Backreference Filters\n\nBackreference filters may be used on their own, or put in front of a [singular backreference](#singular-backreference); this is called a \"filtered backreference\". Multiple backreference filters can be stacked on a single base backreference, but there can only be one base. Any Filter used on its own should be treated as filtering on `^` (youngest message). When counting the messages for a filtered backreference, messages that do not match (e.g. messages by other authors) should not be counted.\n\n~~~\nfiltered backreference = { backreference filter } , (* treat as ^ *) | singular backreference;\nbackreference filter = author backreference filter | message quote filter;\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram}\n\n### Author Backreference Filter\n\nAuthor backreferences reference a message by its author. The syntax of an author backreference is a caret, followed by the name of the author (either as a ping, or with a dot after the \"@\" symbol). An author filter matches on messages that are sent by the specified author.\n\n#### Syntax\n\n~~~\nauthor backreference filter = \"^\" , \"@\" , [ \".\" ], name;\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram}\n\n#### Examples \n\n~~~\n^@nick\n~~~\n{: .language-backreference}\n\nThis backreference refers to the youngest message by Nick.\n\n~~~\n^@.sam^3\n~~~\n{: .language-backreference}\n\nThis backreference refers to the third-youngest message by Sam, while not pinging.\n\n#### Scope\n\nAuthor backreferences should not be used for messages that are over 75 messages (total) old, or 15 messages (of the author) old. Author backreferences should also not be used to reference messages that are younger than 5 messages old, but this may be disregarded in fast-moving chats.\n\n---\n\n### Quote Backreference Filter\n\nQuote filters refer to a message by its content. Quotes may be done in a [Discord-sanctioned format](#quote-backreference) for usage alone, but this syntax is included for combination or for inline usage. This filter matches on messages that contain the string specified by `message text` below.\n\n#### Syntax\n\n~~~\nquote = \"^\" , \"\\\"\" , message text , \"\\\"\";\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram}\n\n#### Scope\n\nQuotes may be used to refer to any message, but in order to prevent the clogging of chat, if any relative backreference method ([caret count](#caret-count-backreference) or  [caret quantity](#caret-quantity-backreference)) is recommended for the message, that should be used instead.\n"},"/versions/4/rules":{"id":"/versions/4/rules","title":"Rules","text":"*Author: Mark*\n\n# Rules while I am King (and hopefully others use these as well):\n\n## Part 1 - Spam:\n\nWhat is spamming in one channel certainly isnt in another. For example, 50 pictures of cute animals back to back in #cuteness-overload wont be considered spamming while 50 votes in #voting would be. Unless if you are obviously spamming (sending one message or pic over and over again) then you will be warned to stop. If you continue then you will be muted for 5 mins and you have to delete your messages along with dming me an apology which will be posted on the weekly news updates.\n\n## Part 2 - Politics\n\nEverything political should go in the chat #paulitics if a post turns political then please move the chat to #paulitics. If you keep debating politics while not in #paulitics (after being warned) then you will face the same punishment that people who spam get (Part 1). \nFurthermore, I would like to add that any political opinions are allowed in this server and you will not be banned for sharing your views. If you dont think that trans-genders are human or support the organisation that is blm then you will not be punished. As long as you are not spamming your views (left or right) then you are free to say whatever. That is not to say people wont hate you if you post pictures of yourself at a KKK rally but censorship will not be used while I am King (and hopefully others follow my example).\n\n## Part 3 - Names:\n\nIf you have a name that doesnt sound like your name then please put your name in parenthesis. \n\nexample of bad names:\n\nree  \nIlikepizza  \ndiamonds  \n\nexample of good names:\n\niron_ore(Bob)  \nBob the Cow  \nree(Bob B.)  \nMr. B  \n"},"/versions":{"id":"/versions","title":"Index","text":"# Versions\n\n* Index\n{:index}\n\n"},"/widget-examples":{"id":"/widget-examples","title":"Widget Examples","text":"# Widget Examples\n\nThis page has examples of all 'widgets' that this site supports.
