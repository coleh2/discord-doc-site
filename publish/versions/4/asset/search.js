            var pageIndex = {"/about-semver":{"id":"/about-semver","title":"About Semver","text":"# Semantic Versioning\n\n## What is it?\n\nSemantic versions, or \"semver\", is a way of formatting version numbers. A bunch of things use it-- \"Minecraft 1.15.2\" is an example; the first number (1) is the \"major version\", the second number (15) is the minor version, and the third number (2) is the patch version. More information can be found [here](https://semver.org/).\n\n## How does this project use it?\n\nWhen making an edit, you should increase the *major* version if:\n\n* There is a major edit; a complete change of format\n\nWhen making an edit, you should increase the *minor* version if:\n\n* There is a smaller edit, like a rule addition or removal, that nevertheless changes the meaning of the document\n\nWhen making an edit, you should increase the *patch* version if:\n\n* You're only changing or clarifying something (e.g. a grammar fix)\n\nWhenever you increase a number, you should reset all less-signifigant numbers to 0 (so a major increase will set both the minor and patch to 0).\n\nOnly major versions get preserved forever publically on this website, but *all* changes (including changes to files that don't belong to a version, such as this one) are accessible through GitHub in markdown format.\n\n## What can I change? Are older versions unchangable?\n\nYeah, kind of. You can change the format (for example, they were transfered from HTML to Markdown in v4.0.0), but their content is unchangable.\n\n"},"/about-site":{"id":"/about-site","title":"About Site","text":"# About the Site\n\n## Why?\n\nPutting things in Discord gives no control over interface, only very basic control over organization, and limited features (images, links, etc). A custom-made markdown-based website (this one!) gives us a relatively low entry barrier to contributing, while greatly expanding the possibilities over a Discord channel.\n\n## How do I contribute? Who can contribute?\n\nAnybody, at any time! If you want to publish something that you think is useful, feel free to make a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/coleh2/discord-doc-site); it has a web-based editor, so there's no need to download the project to your computer.\n\nIf you want to add a custom feature (such as a new type of diagram for people to use, a change to the script that builds the site, etc), that's also definitely allowed-- same procedure, except if you're adding something that others will use, please do some testing-- try to document any tests you've done in your pull request.\n\nIf your addition isn't immediately added, don't worry! Chances are, I just haven't seen it yet. Every request should at least get a comment in response. \n\n### Can I become an admin and help that way?\n\nI'd be glad to accept help! You don't really need technical experience, but a basic understanding of how Git works is good, as well as knowledge of web development if you want.\n\n## Is this affiliated with {person or group}?\n\nThis is made & maintained by @coleh. Any pages that have been written or edited by others will say so.\n\n## This page looks bad\n\nIf it's an actual bug, please take a screenshot and post it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/coleh2/discord-doc-site/issues) on GitHub. If you don't like the design, then still feel free to make an issue-- if you have a pet peeve to fix, a request to make the site better, or any other feedback, I'd love to hear it!\n\n## How is this site hosted? How do we know you're not changing the rules?\n\nThis site is hosted on Netlify, a static site hosting service. Whenever a new version of the site is put up on the [\"master\" Git branch](https://github.com/coleh2/discord-doc-site/tree/master/), GitHub compiles that into a web-viewable version, and then puts that version onto the  [\"publish\" Git branch](https://github.com/coleh2/discord-doc-site/tree/publish/). Netlify sees this and deploys it to their servers. You can be sure I'm not changing the rules behind anyone's back because Git doesn't allow that-- every change submitted is cryptographically linked to those made before; it's extremely difficult if not impossible to falsely edit the pages on this site.\n\n## Is there any way I can contact you that isn't GitHub?\n\nYeah! I'm @coleh on Discord, and coleh@coleh.net for email."},"/versions/1-1-0":{"id":"/versions/1-1-0","title":"1 1 0","text":"# v1.1.0\n\n* Table of Contents\n{:toc}\n\nNote: I tried to make these as comprehensive as possible (as in, a warthog could be a moderator if they follow the rules), but if you think something can be changed, DM me @coleh.\n\n## Section 1: Basic Rules\n\n1.

Only send a message when the last messenger is not you-- you can count up from others' numbers, but not your own.\n3. You may only include alphabetical messages through edits. Common practice is to use parentheses after your number when doing this.\n    a. If the last two digits of your message are \"69\", after sending, you are strongly advised to edit your message to include \"(nice)\" after.\n4. Use of bots, macros, and other counting machines is not allowed. That's not being a good sport.\n\n## Useful Things to Know\n\nAdam has made a bot that enforces most of the guidelines above. However, it gets out of tune sometimes, and needs to be reset; if it's deleting your messages, send `<c reset` to the #bot-poking channel. Adam's bot should acknowledge the command and stop doing that.\n\nSometimes, when in a \"rally\" (quickly counting up when two or more people are active in `#counting` at the same time), Discord will lag out.

Currently, there's an unspecified syntax that serves this purpose, but it has several unclear parts, such as: \n\n* Scope (when quoting should be used instead)\n* Subtypes and their intended usages (e.g. `^^^` vs `^3`)\n* Extensions to the current unspoken standard (e.g.` ^name`)\n* Meaning (agreement vs. simple reference)\n\nThis specification will attempt to be backwards-compatible with most of the current usages. This document should *not* be considered a new, mandatory specification to follow; it's just a clarification. \"Incorrect\" usage should not be seen as an offensive or negative action.\n\nAs such, this specification is established as a clear way to unambiguously reference a previous message on instant messaging platforms, whether for agreement, additional discussion, indication as context, or for other purposes.\n\n## Required Technical Knowledge\n\nThis page should need little to no additional knowledge in order to understand. However, if you don't understand any part, feel free to ask; any questions are very helpful to improve the document.\n\nThe diagrams that describe the syntax are [railroad diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_diagram), a visual representation of the syntax. Each diagram defines a part of the syntax, and then can be referred to and built on by other diagrams. \n\n## Definitions\n\nbackreference\n: A string of text that indicates a previous message\n\ncurrent message\n: The message that has the backreference in it.\n\nyoungest message\n: *most* recently sent, not counting the current message\n\noldest message\n: *least* recently sent, not counting the current message\n\n## General Backreference Specification\n\n### Backreference Usage\n\nAll backreferences must start with a caret character (`^`). All backreferences should be formatted as a seperate word, with spaces before and after. This avoids confusion with exponents.\n\nA message with only a backreference should be seen as a general agreement. If there is any other text in the message, though, it override the implicit agreement. \n\n---\n\n### Syntax\n\n~~~\nbackreference = (singular backreference | plural backreference | filtered backreference);\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram}\n\nYou can test out backreferences and see how they work in this interactive Syntax Explorer, which is pre-loaded with some messages to search.\n\n<script src=\"/versions/4/asset/syntax-check-widget.js\" defer></script>\n<div class=\"syntax-checker-widget\">\n</div>\n---\n\n### I'm a Computer; How Do I Read These?\n\nYou can get an [EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) syntax for backreferences here:\n\n~~~\ndigit = \"0\" | \"1\" | \"2\" | \"3\" | \"4\" | \"5\" | \"6\" | \"7\" | \"8\" | \"9\";\nnumber = { digit };\nletter = \"A\" | \"B\" | \"C\" | \"D\" | \"E\" | \"F\" | \"G\" | \"H\" | \"I\" | \"J\" | \"K\" | \"L\" | \"M\" | \"N\" | \"O\" | \"P\" | \"Q\" | \"R\" | \"S\" | \"T\" | \"U\" | \"V\" | \"W\" | \"X\" | \"Y\" | \"Z\" | \"a\" | \"b\" | \"c\" | \"d\" | \"e\" | \"f\" | \"g\" | \"h\" | \"i\" | \"j\" | \"k\" | \"l\" | \"m\" | \"n\" | \"o\" | \"p\" | \"q\" | \"r\" | \"s\" | \"t\" | \"u\" | \"v\" | \"w\" | \"x\" | \"y\" | \"z\" ;\nsymbol = \"[\" | \"]\" | \"{\" | \"}\" | \"(\" | \")\" | \"<\" | \">\" | \"'\" | '\"' | \"=\" | \"|\" | \".\" | \",\" | \";\";\ncharacter = symbol | digit | letter;\nword = { letter };\nphrase = { word | \" \" | symbol };\nname = word;\nsubject = word;\nmessage text = phrase;\n\nsingular backreference = caret count backreference | caret quantity backreference | quote;\ncaret count backreference = { \"^\" } ;\ncaret quantity backreference = \"^\", number ;\nquote = \"^\" , \"\\\"\" , message text , \"\\\"\";\nplural backreference = backreference range | backreference sequence;\nbackreference range = singular backreference , \"-\" , singular backreference\nbackreference sequence = backreference , { \",\" , backreference }\nfiltered backreference = { backreference filter } , (* treat as ^ *) | singular backreference | plural backreference;\nbackreference filter = author backreference filter | message subject filter;\nauthor backreference filter = \"^\" , [ \"@\" ], name;\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram-source-collection .download-file-instead-of-display data-filename=\"backreference.ebnf\"}\n\n---\n\n### Future Backreference Usage\n\nThe caret is part of Markdown, the formatting language that Discord uses. It's used for ^superscript. Discord has superscript off right now, but if they turn it on, you can use a backslash (`\\`) to ignore its special meaning and continue using backreferences normally. If that is considered too annoying, we'll revise it when we come to that point.\n\n\n## Singular Backreferences\n\nSingular backreferences are the simplest type of backreference. Each one references only a single message.\n\n~~~\nsingular backreference = caret count backreference | caret quantity backreference | quote;\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram}\n\n### Caret Count Backreference\n\nCaret count backreferences reference a message based on relative position. A single caret references the message directly before the current one, a double caret references the message two messages previous, etc. \n\n#### Syntax\n\n~~~\ncaret count backreference = { \"^\" } ;\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram}\n\n#### Examples: \n\n~~~\n^\n~~~\n{: .language-backreference}\n\nThis backreference refers to the youngest message.\n\n~~~\n^^\n~~~\n{: .language-backreference}\n\nThis backreference refers to the second youngest message.\n\n#### Inconsistencies to Note\n\nIn some internet dialects, carets are only used to reference the directly previous message. More carets show a stronger agreement. That's not used here, but it can be carried over when images are posted. The normal number of carets in such usages is 3.\n\n#### Scope\n\nCaret count backreferences shouldn't be used when the message referenced is over five messages ago. To reference an older message, use [caret quantities](#caret-quantity-backreference). However, any number of carets is *technically* valid.\n\n---\n\n### Caret Quantity Backreference\n\nCaret quantities also reference a message relatively. They are different from caret count backreferences in that they use just one caret, followed by a number; this lets them reference older messages without annoying people who have to count tons of carets. To be distinct from exponents in mathematical equations, they must be in their own word.\n\n#### Syntax\n\n~~~\ncaret quantity backreference = \"^\", number ;\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram}\n\n#### Examples\n\n~~~\n^2\n~~~\n{: .language-backreference}\n\nThis backreference refers to the second-youngest message.\n\n~~~\n^7\n~~~\n{: .language-backreference}\n\nThis backreference refers to the seventh-youngest message.\n\n#### Scope\n\nCaret quantities can be used to reference messages as recent as the second-youngest (i.e. `^2`). You *can*, but referring to the youngest message (with `^1`) is discouraged; you can do that easier with a single [caret count](#caret-count-backreference). Caret quantities should not be used to reference messages older than the 12th-youngest (e.g. `^12`)-- if you want to refer to an older message, use an [author backreference](#author-backreference-filter) or a [quote](#quote-backreference). However, any number is technically valid.\n\n---\n\n### Quote Backreference\n\nQuotes refer to a message by its content. When they're alone, do quotes in the Discord/Markdown style (i.e. `> Quoted Text` or right-click > \"Quote\"). If combining with other backreferences, use a [quote filter](#quote-backreference-filter).\n\n#### Scope\n\nQuotes can refer to any message, but to prevent chat clogging, try to use shorter methods first ([caret count](#caret-count-backreference) or  [caret quantity](#caret-quantity-backreference)).\n\n## Plural Backreferences\n\nAll backreferences above this entry are singular; they reference only one message. In some cases, you might want to refer to more than one message at once. To do this, plural backreferences combine two or more singular backreferences together.\n\n\n~~~\nplural backreference = backreference range | backreference sequence;\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram}\n\n### Backreference Ranges\n\nRanges refer from one message to another. To make a range, you can connect two singular backreferences together with a hyphen. The first backreference indicates the first message, and the second indicates the last message. Every message in-between should be considered as referred to. Ranges can oldest-youngest or youngest-oldest; it means the same thing. You can use any 2 singular backreferences.\n\n#### Syntax\n\n~~~\nbackreference range = singular backreference , \"-\" , singular backreference\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram}\n\n#### Examples\n\n~~~\n^3-^5\n~~~\n{: .language-backreference}\n\nThis range refers to all messages from the third-youngest to fifth-youngest messages.\n\n~~~\n^@sam-^@nick^4\n~~~\n{: .language-backreference}\n\nThis range refers to all messages from the youngest message by Sam through the fourth-youngest message by Nick.\n\n#### Scope\n\nSince they're a combination of other backreferences, ranges have no scope of their own. You should satisfy the recommendations of each component.\n\n### Backreference Sequences\n\nBackreference sequences are an alternate method of indicating multiple messages. It allows more fine-grained control than ranges, but is longer. To make a sequence, connect backreferences to each referenced message with a comma. *Any* backreference may be used in a sequence, including ranges and sequences themselves.\n\n#### Syntax \n\n~~~\nbackreference sequence = backreference , { \",\" , backreference }\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram}\n\n#### Examples\n\n~~~\n^^,^^^^\n~~~\n{: .language-backreference}\n\nThis sequence refers to the second-youngest and fourth-youngest messages.\n\n~~~\n^,^^^,^5-^7\n~~~\n{: .language-backreference}\n\nThis sequence refers to the youngest message, the fourth-youngest message, and the fifth-youngest through seventh-youngest messages.\n\n#### Scope\n\nSince they're a combination of other backreferences, sequences have no scope of their own. You should satisfy the recommendations of each component.\n\n## Backreference Filters\n\nBackreference filters may be used on their own, or put in front of a [singular backreference](#singular-backreference); this is called a \"filtered backreference\". Multiple backreference filters can be stacked on a single base backreference, but there can only be one base. Any Filter used on its own should be treated as filtering on `^` (youngest message).\n\nWhen counting messages for a filtered backreference, those that don't match (e.g. messages by other authors) should not be counted.\n\n~~~\nfiltered backreference = { backreference filter } , (* treat as ^ *) | singular backreference;\nbackreference filter = author backreference filter | message quote filter;\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram}\n\n### Author Backreference Filter\n\nAuthor backreferences reference a message by its author. The name doesn't need to be exactly their Discord or real-life name, but it should be unique in the conversation.\n\nThis filter matches on messages that are sent by the specified author.\n\n#### Syntax\n\n~~~\nauthor backreference filter = \"^\" , \"@\" , [ \".\" ], name;\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram}\n\n#### Examples \n\n~~~\n^@nick\n~~~\n{: .language-backreference}\n\nThis backreference refers to the youngest message by Nick.\n\n~~~\n^@.sam^3\n~~~\n{: .language-backreference}\n\nThis backreference refers to the third-youngest message by Sam, while not pinging.\n\n#### Scope\n\nAuthor backreferences shouldn't be used for messages that are over 75 messages (total) old, or 15 messages (of the author) old. Author backreferences should also not be used to reference messages that are younger than 5 messages old, except in fast-moving chats.\n\n---\n\n### Quote Backreference Filter\n\nQuote filters refer to a message by its content. You can quote messages in the [Discord format](#quote-backreference) for usage alone, but this syntax is included for combination or for inline usage. \n\nThis filter matches on messages that contain the `message text` phrase.\n\n#### Syntax\n\n~~~\nquote = \"^\" , \"\\\"\" , message text , \"\\\"\";\n~~~\n{: .language-ebnf .railroad-diagram}\n\n#### Scope\n\nQuotes can refer to any message, but to prevent chat clogging, try to use shorter methods first ([caret count](#caret-count-backreference) or  [caret quantity](#caret-quantity-backreference)).\n"},"/versions/4/rules":{"id":"/versions/4/rules","title":"Rules","text":"*Author: Mark*\n\n# Rules while I am King (and hopefully others use these as well):\n\n## Part 1 - Spam:\n\nWhat is spamming in one channel certainly isnt in another. For example, 50 pictures of cute animals back to back in #cuteness-overload wont be considered spamming while 50 votes in #voting would be. Unless if you are obviously spamming (sending one message or pic over and over again) then you will be warned to stop. If you continue then you will be muted for 5 mins and you have to delete your messages along with dming me an apology which will be posted on the weekly news updates.\n\n## Part 2 - Politics\n\nEverything political should go in the chat #paulitics if a post turns political then please move the chat to #paulitics. If you keep debating politics while not in #paulitics (after being warned) then you will face the same punishment that people who spam get (Part 1). \nFurthermore, I would like to add that any political opinions are allowed in this server and you will not be banned for sharing your views. If you dont think that trans-genders are human or support the organisation that is blm then you will not be punished. As long as you are not spamming your views (left or right) then you are free to say whatever. That is not to say people wont hate you if you post pictures of yourself at a KKK rally but censorship will not be used while I am King (and hopefully others follow my example).\n\n## Part 3 - Names:\n\nIf you have a name that doesnt sound like your name then please put your name in parenthesis. \n\nexample of bad names:\n\nree  \nIlikepizza  \ndiamonds  \n\nexample of good names:\n\niron_ore(Bob)  \nBob the Cow  \nree(Bob B.)  \nMr. B  \n\n## Part 4 - Votes:\n\nFirst of all, as a reminder, votes are suggestions and while I will listen to most of them I am not required to do so. The purpose is to see what you all want and to see if you like a change, hate it, or simply do not have a preference. However here are some clarifying rules, 1, in order for a change to be considered it has to be put in voting so I know what other people think, 2, If I find that a vote is simply spam I will delete it (and you will face the same punishment for spamming), 3, If a vote is something that will really change the server (like a new section or electing stuff) then dm it to me and it will be put here.\n\n## Part 5 - Elections:\n\nSo most of this stuff has already been voted on so I will just list it here (along with some other stuff). A potential King runs with a Hand of their choosing, the King gains ownership of the server while the Hand gains admin. No leader (King or Hand) can be in power (have admin) two terms in a row. In order (for King) to run you need to put me in a dm chat with you, your Hand, and three others who will vote for you and only you. \n\nAlright this was just my quick update on the rules and I should be done (unless if I think of something else) :slight_smile:\n\n## Part 6 - Saying first after a channel is created:\n\nDon't.\n\n## Part 7- Breaking the rules of an individual chat:\n\nLets say you are in a chat like #hamilton were the clear intention typing out the verses and you say \"I like pizza\" or \"this chat sucks\" then you will be warned about it and three warnings leads to punishment for spam. Basically try not to mess up a chat that has a theme to it.\n\n## Part 8 - #general , #images-and-videos ,and #memes :\n\n#general is used for basic conversation and discussion. You are allowed to post an image or video in #general if it relates to the discussion. Discussions regarding an image or video or if you just want to post a cool video or image then use #images-and-videos. The motto for #images-and-videos is \"less is more\", if you want to post a lot of images or videos then do that in #memes. Anything that you think would qualify as a meme would also go in #memes. This is not an exact science and there wont really be an issue unless if somebody is spamming memes in #general or #images-and-videos or having a political discussion in #memes.\n\n## Part 9 - Simplified punishments:\n\nBasically, unless if what you are doing is obvious spam then you will get three warnings. If you reach three warnings or are obviously spamming then you will be muted until you send me an apology via dms which will be posted in #news.
